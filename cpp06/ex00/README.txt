About us

We are a small, committed 6-member team that lives the open-source spirit and is always open to new ideas and solutions. We value open communication within a flat hierarchy.

Four of us identify as women, 5 of us are white, one person is Indian. And while we are all without visible disabilities, we hope to have developed a team culture that feels welcoming and inclusive to everyone. Some of us have traditional IT education backgrounds, others have pivoted their careers from other fields into programming. We value diversity of identities and working backgrounds to bring broader perspectives to our team and into the software we develop. English is our interpersonal working language. For some meetings with internal and external stakeholders a basic understanding of spoken German will be helpful.
