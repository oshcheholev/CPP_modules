Hello, Mr Mayer!

Stefanie Wurshits kindly shared your contact with me regarding the 20-hour job opportunity at Angewandte. 
I believe she may have already forwarded you my CV but I am attaching it to this letter.

Although my hands-on experience with Python and Django is still at a junior level, 
I have a solid understanding of the fundamentals 
and, more importantly, I’m fully committed to learn and adapt quickly.

Since relocating to Vienna due to the war in Ukraine, for the past 1.5 years 
I’ve been studying at 42 Vienna — an intensive, project-based coding school,
where I have gained strong experience in C and C++ through many peer-driven projects. 
This environment trained me to solve complex problems independently,
collaborate effectively, and continuously acquire new skills — and I’m always ready for more.

There’s still some time before this job begins, and I’m able to pause my studies if needed. 
I would gladly dedicate all my time to prepare myself and get up to speed with everything required for this role.

If you’re open to it, I would be happy to take on a test task or assignment to demonstrate my motivation and learning ability.

Please know that I don’t see this as just a “20-hour job.” 
Especially in the beginning, I’m ready to invest much more time and energy than what’s officially required — 
even if I’m only paid for the standard hours. 
What you’ll get with me is someone truly committed and motivated to contribute to the success of the team.

Best regards,
Oleksandr Shcheholev
